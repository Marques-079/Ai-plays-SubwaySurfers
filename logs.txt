hmmm wait so then cant we be greedy with our auto labeller? 
picking only the best state in the moment? Becuase when we train our transformer 
we give context 8 frames and we predict what needs to happen in the given moment, 
regardless of the pass. A sucessfuly training siutation would be that we are mid air 
but want to move right we move right, and pass the past 8 frames (in which we jumped) 
into the transformer. So in game when a similar siutation comes up EG. 
we jumped (seen in last 8 frames) and now where do we want to move? to the right!

Establish a mechanism to label data given a single frame. Give nthe frame it will greedily pick the best region it wants 
to be in and then return the move which best achieves this goal. Very key stage here as not 
only labels our data but during inferemce this also makes decsions.

Train a transformer on CNN encoded frames paired with the augmented data labels created by pairing video frames with
the identification mechanism. This will allow for combos to be formed with a chain of images being the past moves
and the transformer predicts the next move (with context) unlike our greedy labeller.

//Can we train our CNN on game state variables?

In inference we pass the frame into the CNN for encoding and pass those collection of frames into the transformer for prediction.
I dont think we shoud use the autolabeller in the actual inference pipeline because transformer should learn labels off the autolabeller
Im gonna use gamestate variables to train the auto labeller for high accuracy label generation.

//Starting on the auto labeller now 
Tossing up whether to do a decison tree or a hand coded if/else linchpin

Im thinking being able to identify high and low ground and currnent standing point is extremely crucial to labelling
ill need to implment a distance to consider jumping from also, game speed may be a complication
drawing out 3 possbile lines because subway surfers always curves left?

Logically it makes sense to stay on train tops as long as possbile to avoid getting blocked in (worst case we bail side)

Today I made the desicion to switch to computer vision for obstacle detection - currently using roboflow to train models
spent a few hours labelling data, plan is after this is to use this mdoel which has low accuracy and use it to label more data 
which I will hand review (faster than me drawing on each individual image) and then ill retrain the model. 

Will keep ground neon green logic as I think it may be useful for pathfinding and bail situiations. 
Also will stick to the classic version of Subway Surfers due to plentful amounts of videos online (10+ hours at least)
